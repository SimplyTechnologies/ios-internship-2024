## Style

Refer to the [Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/anikhechoyansimply/swift-style-guide) for general code styling conventions.

## Source Control Naming Conventions

### Branch Naming

Branches are named using the following format: <br/>
`{prefix}/{task-description}`

**Prefix** can be:
- `feature`: Tasks and user stories
- `bug`: Bug fixes and small improvements

**Task description** should be a short and meaningful lowercased text, and should use dashes (-) as the delimeter.

Examples: <br/>
`feature/signup-form` <br/>
`bug/email-validation`

### Commit Message 

Commit messages are short descriptions of the task.

Example: <br/>
`Vehicle hero image.` <br/>

### Pull Request

Pull requests are named using either `Feature` or `Bug` prefix. The full format is: <br/>
`{prefix}/{task description}`

Examples: <br/>
`Feature/Signup form` <br/>
`Bug/Email validation`
<br/><br/>
> **Note**: There may be exceptions when the change is not a feature or bug. Use only the task descriptions for that cases.

Add ticket link in the comment.
